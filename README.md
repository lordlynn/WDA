Wireless Data Acquisition. 


This project utilizes Teensy4.1 and WizFi360 board to create the embedded portion of the wireless data acquisition system.

Any computer capable of running python3 applications and an MQTT broker simultaneously will be sufficient for the PC portion of the system.

Any wifi router can be used as the middle man between the embedded and PC systems.
